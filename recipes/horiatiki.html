        As said before, the secret to make a delicious Greek salad is in the

        quality extra virgin olive oil and some tangy black olives will really

        To make this Greek salad recipe (Horiatiki), start by preparing your
        vegetables. Wash thoroughly and strain the vegetables. Cut the tomatoes
        into wedges, slice the onion into thin rings, cut the cucumber in thick
        slices and place everything in a large bowl. Don’t forget to add the
        olives as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season with salt and pour over the extra virgin olive oil and vinegar.
        Toss everything together, so that the flavours mix. Be careful not to
        add too much salt, as the feta cheese and the olives are salty enough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Greek salad (Horiatiki) is always served with feta cheese on top, a
        drizzle of olive oil and dried oregano. Enjoy your delicious Greek salad
        as a side dish or as a light summer meal with lots of crusty bread
        aside!
